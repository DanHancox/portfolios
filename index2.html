        <img class="portrait" src="/images/IMG-2020.jpg">
        
        <p>Hello everyone! I'm a front end developer based in England and France, currently undertaking
            a course with Manchester Codes. My original background was as a brewer of beer and distiller
            of spirits, a job I love but it's time for a change. I got into the world of software 
            engineering to compliment my life in both England and France.</p>

        <h3>What I Offer</h3>
        <p>I am a dedicated, hard working individual who loves to be challenged</p>

        <p>Creme tangerine and Montelimar,
            A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
            Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news.
            But you'll have to have them all pulled out,
            After the Savoy truffle,
            Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart,
            I feel your taste all the time we're apart,
            Coconut fudge really blows down those blues.
            But you'll have to have them all pulled out,
            After the Savoy truffle</p>
